                    Immersive culinary experts Bompas & Parr to bring exclusive experience to Expo a unique Future of Food dining concept will lead guests on multi-sensory journey.  Experience to include Digital Canapés, part of a collaboration with new platform, Artcryption
                    A pioneering culinary experience inspired by space, microbiology, artificial intelligence and hyperintelligence will stir the senses of curious diners at Expo 2020 Dubai, in a new concept designed to challenge the future of dining.
                    The Future of Food: Epochal Banquet is a never-before-seen experience cooked up by UK-based multi-sensory experience design studio Bompas & Parr, in collaboration with Expo 2020. The ground-breaking foodie adventure will feature numerous world firsts, taking creativity, innovation and technology to a new level.
                    Today, Bompas & Parr collaborate with new NFT platform, Artcryption, to bring Digital Canapés to the Epochal Banquet - a world first in food NFTs. Through a series of curated commissions, Bompas & Parr and Artcryption ask artists and designers to imagine the future of a digital canapé - one fit for display at the Future of Food: Epochal Banquet.
                    The immersive Expo experience is inspired by the ‘Novacene’, a new era hypothesised by eminent 102-year-old scientist and inventor James Lovelock. The new age, he prophesises, will take over the ‘Anthropocene’ era, in which humans have been able to make large-scale changes to the planetary environment, and introduce a future where robots and artificial intelligence will rule. Realising food for a digital world feels fit for the era hypothesised by Lovelock - one where food sources become diminished due to AI takeovers - will sensorial and luxury food be obsolete in the imminent future, and only available for enjoyment in digital format? As our current world tumbles towards NFT everything, this collaboration will allow us to see what happens when something as tangibly enjoyable as food becomes virtual and exclusive. Is the new luxury an exclusively designed edible Digital Canapé? Canapés have traditionally been served alongside drinks and to support dinners, originating in the 1800s in France. The word Canapé literally translates to ‘sofa’, drawing the analogy that the garnish sits atop a piece of bread as people do on a sofa. So what happens when they go digital? We are spending increasing amounts of time sitting on our sofas, scrolling through social media, that we ourselves have become Canapés, consuming content at alarming rates. A Digital Canapé becomes a Canapé for the Canapé of sorts...
                    The curated exhibition will result in the first ever menu of food NFTs, dressed under the guise of ‘Digital Canapés’. Selected artists will have their digital food artworks minted on Blockchain. Those lucky enough to secure a ticket to Dubai Expo 2020 will be able to purchase a one of a kind Digital Canapé, ready for consumption at the tap of a button on their devices at the Expo finale in 2022.
                    Bompas & Parr and Artcryption hope for this to be a world first, exploring the boundaries between the physical and the virtual within the food industry. After all, canapés are something to be enjoyed, often setting the tone for an evening or event - do they even need to by consumed by mouth - is digital the answer to set the aforementioned tone? The collaboration will open up a series of events, starting with Dubai Expo, on the exploration of NFT foods and their place in our futures.
